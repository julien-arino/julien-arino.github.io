 abstract = {Stochastic simulations of network models have become the standard approach to studying epidemics. We show that many of the predictions of these models can also be obtained from simple classical deterministic compartmental models. We suggest that simple models may be a better way to plan for a threatening pandemic with location and parameters as yet unknown, reserving more detailed network models for disease outbreaks already underway in localities where the social networks are well identified. We formulate compartmental models to describe outbreaks of influenza and attempt to manage a disease outbreak by vaccination or antiviral treatment. The models give an important prediction that may not have been noticed in other models, namely that the number of doses of antiviral treatment required is extremely sensitive to the number of initial infectives. This suggests that the actual number of doses needed cannot be estimated with any degree of reliability. The model is applicable to pre-epidemic vaccination, such as annual vaccination programs in anticipation of an "ordinary" influenza outbreak with limited drift, and as a combination of treatment both before and during an epidemic.},

Then time discrete models describing in a detailed way cellular division are studied, followed by ordinary differential equations systems verifying the mass conservation principle, and finally by a class of models that do not verify this property.

The latter influences the severity of the outbreaks when they do take place. Quarantine after arrival in a location is an efficacious way to reduce the rate of importations. Locations that see no or low-level local transmission should ensure that the rate of importations remains low.

The model, which assumes that vector reproduction can lead to the transmission or loss of resistance (reversion), is analyzed in a particular case with specified forms for the birth and force of infection functions. The vector component can have, in the absence of disease, a coexistence equilibrium where both strains survive. In the case where reversion is possible, this coexistence equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when it exists. This equilibrium is still present in the full vector-host system, leading to a reduction of the associated reproduction number, thereby making elimination of the disease more feasible. When reversion is not possible, there can exist an additional equilibrium with only resistant vectors.},

 abstract = {Background The anticipated extent of antiviral use during an influenza pandemic can have adverse consequences for the development of drug resistance and rationing of limited stockpiles. The strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses. Methods We employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential, and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections. Using estimated parameters in the published literature, the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies. Results We demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high. However, moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles, leading to run-out, by promoting wide-spread drug resistance. We applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. Our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak, a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude. However, a timely implementation of wide-scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population, and minimize the final size of the pandemic. Conclusion Our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run-out. For a 1918-like strain, the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20\% of the population.},

A general form of the vaccine waning function is assumed, and the interplay of this together with the vaccine efficacy and vaccination rates is discussed. The integro-differential system describing the model is studied for a constant vaccine waning rate, in which case it reduces to an ODE system, and for a constant waning period, in which case it reduces to a system of delay differential equations. For some parameter values, the model is shown to exhibit a backward bifurcation, leading to the existence of subthreshold endemic equilibria. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the consequence of this bifurcation in terms of epidemic control. The model can alternatively be interpreted as one consisting of two social groups, with education playing the role of vaccination.},

 abstract = {A model is formulated that describes the spatial propagation of a disease that can be transmitted between multiple species. The spatial component consists, for each species, of a certain number of patches that make up the vertices of a digraph, the arcs of which represent the movement of the various species between the patches. In each of the patches and for each species, a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model describes the evolution of the disease status of individuals. Also in each patch, there is transmission of the disease from species to species. An analysis of the system is given, beginning with results on the mobility component. A formula is derived for the computation of the basic reproduction number R0 for sspecies and npatches, which then determines the global stability properties of the disease free equilibrium. Simulations for the spread of a disease in one species and two patches are presented.},

@article{ArinoPilyuginWolkowicz2005,
 abstract = {We investigate some properties of a very general model of growth in the chemostat. In the classical models of the chemostat, the function describing cellular growth is assumed to be a constant multiple of the function modeling substrate uptake. The constant of proportionality is called the growth yield constant. Here, this assumption of a constant describing growth yield is relaxed. Instead, we assume that the relationship between uptake and growth might depend on the substrate concentration and hence that the yield is variable. We obtain criteria for the stability of equilibria and for the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation. In particular, a Hopf bifurcation can occur if the uptake function is unimodal. Then, in this setting, we consider competition in the chemostat for a single substrate, in order to challenge the principle of competitive exclusion. We consider two examples. In the first, the function describing the growth process is monotone and in the second it is unimodal. In both examples, in order to obtain a Hopf bifurcation, one of the competitors is assumed to have a variable yield, and its "uptake" is described by a unimodal function. However, the interpretation is different in each case. We provide a necessary condition for strong coexistence and a sufficient condition that guarantees the extinction of one or more species. We show numerically by means of bifurcation diagrams and simulations, that the competitive exclusion principle can be breached resulting in oscillatory coexistence of more than one species, that competitor-mediated coexistence is possible, and that these simple systems can have very complicated dynamics.},

Because of the difference in population sizes, the urban centre has standard incidence and satellite cities have mass action incidence. It is shown that the general basic reproduction number $\R_0$ acts as a threshold between global asymptotic stability of the disease free equilibrium and disease persistence. The case of Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) and some neighbouring satellite communities is then considered numerically to complement the mathematical analysis, highlighting the importance of taking into account not only $\R_0$ but also other measures of disease severity. It is found that the large urban centre governs most of the behaviour of the general system and control of the spread is better achieved by targeting it rather than reducing movement between the units. Also, the capacity of a satellite city to affect the general system depends on its population size and its connectivity to the main urban centre.},

The basic reproduction number R0 is calculated, with the disease dying out in each patch if $R_0 < 1$. If travel is assumed to be independent of disease status, then numerical results are cited that indicate that for $R_0 > 1$ solutions tend to an endemic equilibrium with the disease present in each patch. The system is extended to include cross infection between several species. A second extension involves keeping track of both the current patch and the patch in which an individual usually resides. Travel can change disease spread in a complicated way; it may help the disease to persist or may aid disease extinction.

More generally, an arbitrarily distributed sojourn time in a state, for example, the infective or immune state, is used by some authors (see [69] and the references therein).},

 abstract = {We derive an alternative expression for a delayed logistic equation, assuming that the rate of change of the population depends on three components: growth, death, and intraspecific competition, with the delay in the growth component. In our formulation, we incorporate the delay in the growth term in a manner consistent with the rate of instantaneous decline in the population given by the model. We provide a complete global analysis, showing that, unlike the dynamics of the classical logistic delay differential equation (DDE) model, no sustained oscillations are possible. Just as for the classical logistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) growth model, all solutions approach a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. However, unlike both the logistic ODE and DDE growth models, the value of this equilibrium depends on all of the parameters, including the delay, and there is a threshold that determines whether the population survives or dies out. In particular, if the delay is too long, the population dies out. When the population survives, i.e., the attracting equilibrium has a positive value, we explore how this value depends on the parameters. When this value is positive, solutions of our DDE model seem to be well approximated by solutions of the logistic ODE growth model with this carrying capacity and an appropriate choice for the intrinsic growth rate that is independent of the initial conditions.},

@article{AruffoYuanTanGatov_etal2022,
 abstract = {Background
Since December 2020, public health agencies have implemented a variety of vaccination strategies to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with pre-existing Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Initial strategies focused on vaccinating the elderly to prevent hospitalizations and deaths, but with vaccines becoming available to the broader population, it became important to determine the optimal strategy to enable the safe lifting of NPIs while avoiding virus resurgence.

Methods
We extended the classic deterministic SIR compartmental disease-transmission model to simulate the lifting of NPIs under different vaccine rollout scenarios. Using case and vaccination data from Toronto, Canada between December 28, 2020, and May 19, 2021, we estimated transmission throughout past stages of NPI escalation/relaxation to compare the impact of lifting NPIs on different dates on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, given varying degrees of vaccine coverages by 20-year age groups, accounting for waning immunity.

Results
We found that, once coverage among the elderly is high enough (80% with at least one dose), the main age groups to target are 20–39 and 40–59 years, wherein first-dose coverage of at least 70% by mid-June 2021 is needed to minimize the possibility of resurgence if NPIs are to be lifted in the summer. While a resurgence was observed for every scenario of NPI lifting, we also found that under an optimistic vaccination coverage (70% coverage by mid-June, along with postponing reopening from August 2021 to September 2021) can reduce case counts and severe outcomes by roughly 57% by December 31, 2021.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that focusing the vaccination strategy on the working-age population can curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, even with high vaccination coverage in adults, increasing contacts and easing protective personal behaviours is not advisable since a resurgence is expected to occur, especially with an earlier reopening.},

Here, we incorporate these factors into a vaccination model to investigate and compare the effectiveness of the single-dose and two-dose vaccine strategies. The results show that, if vaccination starts early enough after the onset of the outbreak, a two-dose strategy can lead to a greater reduction in the total number of infections. This, however, requires the second dose of vaccine to confer a substantially higher protection compared to that induced by the first dose. For a sufficiently long delay in start of vaccination, the single-dose strategy outperforms the two-dose vaccination program regardless of its protection efficacy. These findings suggest that the population-wide benefits of a single-dose strategy could in general be greater than the two-dose vaccination program, in particular when the second dose offers marginal increase in the protection induced by the first dose.},

Mass gatherings can not only trigger major outbreaks on-site but also facilitate global spread of infectious pathogens. Hajj is one of the largest mass gathering events worldwide where over two million pilgrims from all over the world gather annually creating intense congestion.
Methods
We developed a meta-population model to represent the transmission dynamics of Neisseria meningitidis and the impact of Hajj pilgrimage on the risk of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) for pilgrims population, local population at the Hajj site and country of origin of Hajj pilgrims. This model was calibrated using data on IMD over 17 years (1995-2011) and further used to simulate potential changes in vaccine policy and endemic conditions.
Results
The effect of increased density of contacts during Hajj was estimated to generate a 78-fold increase in disease transmission that impacts not only pilgrims but also the local population. Quadrivalent ACWY vaccination was found to be very effective in reducing the risk of outbreak during Hajj. Hajj has more limited impact on IMD transmission and exportation in the pilgrim countries of origin, although not negligible given the size of the population considered.
Conclusion
The analysis performed highlighted the amplifying effect of mass gathering on N. meningitidis transmission and confirm vaccination as a very effective preventive measure to mitigate outbreak risks.},

 abstract = {Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes is poorly documented. Using surveillance data of 228 European private nursing homes, we estimated weekly SARS-CoV-2 incidences among 21,467 residents and 14,371 staff members, compared to that in the general population, between August 3, 2020, and February 20, 2021. We studied the outcomes of “episodes of introduction” where one case was first detected and computed attack rates, reproduction ratio (R), and dispersion parameter (k). Out of 502 episodes of SARS-CoV-2 introduction, 77.1% (95%CI, 73.2%-80.6%) led to additional cases. Attack rates were highly variable, ranging from 0.4% to 86.5%. The R was 1.16 (95%CI, 1.11-1.22) with k at 2.5 (95%CI, 0.5-4.5). The timing of viral circulation in nursing homes did not mirror that in the general population (p-values<0.001). We estimated the impact of vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Before vaccination's roll-out, a cumulated 5,579 SARS-CoV-2 infections were documented among residents and 2,321 among staff. Higher staffing ratio and previous natural immunization reduced the probability of an outbreak following introduction. Despite strong preventive measures, transmission likely occurred, regardless of building characteristics. Vaccination started on January 15, 2021, and coverage reached 65.0% among residents, and 42.0% among staff by February 20, 2021. Vaccination yielded a 92% reduction (95%CI, 71%-98%) of outbreak probability, and lowered R to 0.87 (95%CI, 0.69-1.10). In the post-pandemic era, much attention will have to be paid to multi-lateral collaboration, policy making, and prevention plans.},

We first use ordinary and impulsive differential equations to describe disease spread and the application of control measures once a certain infection level is detected. These models help determine when and how often interventions should occur. To capture the early stages of the disease and the chance that it might die out by itself, we then use a continuous-time Markov chain approach.

Such large-scale MGEs can potentially lead to outbreaks of infectious disease and contribute to the global dissemination of such pathogens. Here we adapt previous work and create a generalisable model framework for assessing the use of disease control strategies at such events, in terms of reducing infections and hospitalisations. This framework utilises a combination of meta-populations based on clusters of people and their vaccination status, Ordinary Differential Equation integration between fixed time events, and Latin Hypercube sampling. We use the FIFA 2022 World Cup as a case study for this framework (modelling each match as independent 7 day MGEs). Pre-travel screenings of visitors were found to have little effect in reducing COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations. With pre-match screenings of spectators and match staff being more effective. Rapid Antigen (RA) screenings 0.5 days before match day performed similarly to RT-PCR screenings 1.5 days before match day. Combinations of pre-travel and pre-match testing led to improvements. However, a policy of ensuring that all visitors had a COVID-19 vaccination (second or booster dose) within a few months before departure proved to be much more efficacious. The State of Qatar abandoned all COVID-19 related travel testing and vaccination requirements over the period of the World Cup. Our work suggests that the State of Qatar may have been correct in abandoning the pre-travel testing of visitors. However, there was a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations within Qatar over the World Cup. Given our findings and the spike in cases, we suggest a policy requiring visitors to have had a recent COVID-19 vaccination should have been in place to reduce cases and hospitalisations.},

@article{HansenDayArinoEtAl2010,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) for the treatment of ill individuals has been an important intervention during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. However, the emergence and spread of drug resistance remains a major concern and, therefore, optimizing antiviral strategies is crucial to retain the longterm effectiveness of these pharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: A dynamic model of disease transmission was developed to investigate optimal scenarios for the use of a secondary drug (eg, zanamivir). Considering both small and large stockpiles, attack rates were projected by simulating the model to identify "tipping points" for switching to zanamivir as resistance to oseltamivir develops. RESULTS: The use of a limited stockpile of zanamivir can substantially reduce the overall attack rate during pandemic outbreaks. For a reasonably large stockpile of zanamivir, it is optimal to delay the use of this drug for a certain amount of time during which oseltamivir is used as the primary drug. For smaller stockpiles, however, earlier use of zanamivir will be most effective in reducing the overall attack rate. Given a limited stockpile of zanamivir (1.8\% in the Canadian plan) without replenishment, and assuming that the fraction of ill individuals being treated is maintained below 60\%, the results suggest that zanamivir should be dispensed as the primary drug for thresholds of the cumulative number of oseltamivir resistance below 20\%. INTERPRETATION: Strategic use of a secondary drug becomes crucial for pandemic mitigation if vaccination and other interventions fail to sufficiently reduce disease transmission in the community. These findings highlight the importance of enhanced surveillance and clinical monitoring for rapid identification of resistance emergence and its population incidence, so that optimal timing for adaptation to the use of drugs can be achieved.},

Until June 2021, Atlantic Canada and Canada{\textquoteright}s territories had also experienced prolonged periods with few SARS-CoV-2 community cases. Such regions had a need for epidemiological models that could assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, but most existing frameworks are applicable to regions where SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in the community, and so it was necessary to adapt existing frameworks to meet this need. We distinguish between infections that are travel-related and those that occur in the community, and find that in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island the mean percentage of daily cases that were travel-related was 80\% or greater (July 1, 2020 {\textendash} May 31, 2021). We show that by December 24, 2021, the daily probability of an Omicron variant community outbreak establishing in NL was near one, and nearly twice as high as the previous high, which occurred in September 2021 when the Delta variant was dominant. We evaluate how vaccination and new variants might affect hypothetical future outbreaks in Mt. Pearl, NL. Our modelling framework can be used to evaluate alternative plans to relax public health restrictions when high levels of vaccination are achieved in regions that have implemented an elimination strategy.Competing Interest StatementAH, MM, and JL-O were members of the Newfoundland and Labrador Predictive Analytics Modelling team and AH received funding from the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Health and Community Services.

 abstract = {Infectious disease surveillance for mass gatherings (MGs) can be directed locally and globally; however, epidemic intelligence from these two levels is not well integrated. Modelling activities related to MGs have historically focused on crowd behaviours around MG focal points and their relation to the safety of attendees. The integration of developments in internet-based global infectious disease surveillance, transportation modelling of populations travelling to and from MGs, mobile phone technology for surveillance during MGs, metapopulation epidemic modelling, and crowd behaviour modelling is important for progress in MG health. Integration of surveillance across geographic frontiers and modelling across scientific specialties could produce the first real-time risk monitoring and assessment platform that could strengthen awareness of global infectious disease threats before, during, and immediately after MGs. An integrated platform of this kind could help identify infectious disease threats of international concern at the earliest stages possible; provide insights into which diseases are most likely to spread into the MG; help with anticipatory surveillance at the MG; enable mathematical modelling to predict the spread of infectious diseases to and from MGs; simulate the effect of public health interventions aimed at different local and global levels; serve as a foundation for scientific research and innovation in MG health; and strengthen engagement between the scientific community and stakeholders at local, national, and global levels.},

 abstract = {Objective To evaluate the screening measures that would have been required to assess all travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico by air at the start of the 2009 pandemic. Methods Data from flight itineraries for travellers who flew from Mexico were used to estimate the number of international airports where health screening measures would have been needed, and the number of travellers who would have had to be screened, to assess all air travellers who could have transported the H1N1 influenza virus out of Mexico during the initial stages of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Findings Exit screening at 36 airports in Mexico, or entry screening of travellers arriving on direct flights from Mexico at 82 airports in 26 other countries, would have resulted in the assessment of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico at the start of the pandemic. Entry screening of 116 travellers arriving from Mexico by direct or connecting flights would have been necessary for every one traveller at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09. Screening at just eight airports would have resulted in the assessment of 90\% of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico in the early stages of the pandemic. Conclusion During the earliest stages of the A(H1N1) pandemic, most public health benefits potentially attainable through the screening of air travellers could have been achieved by screening travellers at only eight airports.},

 abstract = {Background. Every year millions of pilgrims from around the world gather under extremely crowded conditions in Mecca, Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj. In 2009, the Hajj coincided with influenza season during the midst of an influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. After the Hajj, resource-limited countries with large numbers of traveling pilgrims could be vulnerable, given their limited ability to purchase H1N1 vaccine and capacity to respond to a possible wave of H1N1 introduced via returning pilgrims. Methods. We studied the worldwide migration of pilgrims traveling to Mecca to perform the Hajj in 2008 using data from the Saudi Ministry of Health and international air traffic departing Saudi Arabia after the 2008 Hajj using worldwide airline ticket sales data. We used gross national income (GNI) per capita as a surrogate marker of a country's ability to mobilize an effective response to H1N1. Results. In 2008, 2.5 million pilgrims from 140 countries performed the Hajj. Pilgrims (1.7 million) were of international (non-Saudi) origin, of which 91.0\% traveled to Saudi Arabia via commercial flights. International pilgrims (11.3\%) originated from low-income countries, with the greatest numbers traveling from Bangladesh (50,419), Afghanistan (32,621), and Yemen (28,018). Conclusions. Nearly 200,000 pilgrims that performed the Hajj in 2008 originated from the world's most resource-limited countries, where access to H1N1 vaccine and capacity to detect and respond to H1N1 in returning pilgrims are extremely limited. International efforts may be needed to assist resource-limited countries that are vulnerable to the impact of H1N1 during the 2009 to 2010 influenza season.},

 abstract = {Public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic varied across the world. Some countries (e.g. mainland China, New Zealand and Taiwan) implemented elimination strategies involving strict travel measures and periods of rigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the community, aiming to achieve periods with no disease spread; while others (e.g. many European countries and the USA) implemented mitigation strategies involving less strict NPIs for prolonged periods, aiming to limit community spread. Travel measures and community NPIs have high economic and social costs, and there is a need for guidelines that evaluate the appropriateness of an elimination or mitigation strategy in regional contexts. To guide decisions, we identify key criteria and provide indicators and visualizations to help answer each question. Considerations include determining whether disease elimination is: (1) necessary to ensure healthcare provision; (2) feasible from an epidemiological point of view and (3) cost-effective when considering, in particular, the economic costs of travel measures and treating infections. We discuss our recommendations by considering the regional and economic variability of Canadian provinces and territories, and the epidemiological characteristics of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. While elimination may be a preferable strategy for regions with limited healthcare capacity, low travel volumes, and few ports of entry, mitigation may be more feasible in large urban areas with dense infrastructure, strong economies, and with high connectivity to other regions.},

 abstract = {Seasonal influenza poses a significant public health and economic burden, associated with the outcome of infection and resulting complications. The true burden of the disease is difficult to capture due to the wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic cases to non-respiratory complications such as cardiovascular events, and its seasonal variability. An understanding of the magnitude of the true annual incidence of influenza is important to support prevention and control policy development and to evaluate the impact of preventative measures such as vaccination. We use a dynamic disease transmission model, laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data, and randomized-controlled trial (RCT) data to quantify the underestimation factor, expansion factor, and symptomatic influenza illnesses in the US and Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. Based on 2 case definitions, we estimate between 0.42-3.2% and 0.33-1.2% of symptomatic influenza illnesses were laboratory-confirmed in Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, respectively. In the US, we estimate between 0.08-0.61% and 0.07-0.33% of symptomatic influenza illnesses were laboratory-confirmed in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, respectively. We estimated the symptomatic influenza illnesses in Canada to be 0.32-2.4 million in 2011-2012 and 1.8-8.2 million in 2012-2013. In the US, we estimate the number of symptomatic influenza illnesses to be 4.4-34 million in 2011-2012 and 23-102 million in 2012-2013. We illustrate that monitoring a representative group within a population may aid in effectively modelling the transmission of infectious diseases such as influenza. In particular, the utilization of RCTs in models may enhance the accuracy of epidemiological parameter estimation.},

 abstract = {Disease modelling is increasingly being used to evaluate the effect of health intervention strategies, particularly for infectious diseases. However, the utility and application of such models are hampered by the inconsistent use of infectious disease modelling terms between and within disciplines. We sought to standardize the lexicon of infectious disease modelling terms, and develop a glossary of terms commonly used in describing models’ assumptions, parameters, variables, and outcomes. We combined a comprehensive literature review of relevant terms with an online forum discussion in a virtual community of practice, mod4PH (Modelling for Public Health). Using a convergent discussion process and consensus amongst the members of mod4PH, a glossary of terms was developed as an online resource. We anticipate that the glossary will improve inter- and intra-disciplinary communication, and will result in a greater uptake and understanding of disease modelling outcomes in heath policy decision-making. We highlight the role of the mod4PH community of practice and the methodologies used in this endeavour to link theory, policy, and practice in the public health domain.},

Cruise ships bring diverse populations into proximity for many days, facilitating the transmission of respiratory illnesses. The objective of this study is to develop a modeling framework to inform the development of viable disease risk management policies and measures to control disease outbreaks on cruises. Our model, parameterized and calibrated using the data of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in 2020, is used to assess the impact of the mitigation measures such as mask wearing, vaccination, on-board and pre-traveling testing measures. Our results indicate mask wearing in public places as the cheapest and most affordable measure can drop the number of cumulative confirmed cases by almost 50%. This measure along with the vaccination by declining the number of the cumulative confirmed cases by more than 94% is the most effective measure to control outbreaks on cruises. According to our findings, outbreaks are more predominant in the passenger population than the crew members, however, the protection measures are more beneficial if they are applied by both crew members and passengers. Regarding the testing measure, pre-traveling testing is more functional than the on-board testing to control outbreaks on cruises.},

Significant advancements were noted in the development of predictive models, with examples from various countries showcasing the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in detecting and monitoring disease trends. The role of open collaboration between various stakeholders in modelling was stressed, advocating for the continuation of such partnerships beyond the pandemic. A major gap identified was the absence of a common international framework for data sharing, which is crucial for global pandemic preparedness.

 abstract = {Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), likely a bat-origin coronavirus, spilled over from wildlife to humans in China in late 2019, manifesting as a respiratory disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread initially within China and then globally, resulting in a pandemic.
Objective: This article describes predictive modelling of COVID-19 in general, and efforts within the Public Health Agency of Canada to model the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Canadian population to support public health decisions.
Methods: The broad objectives of two modelling approaches, 1) an agent-based model and 2) a deterministic compartmental model, are described and a synopsis of studies is illustrated using a model developed in Analytica 5.3 software.
Results: Without intervention, more than 70% of the Canadian population may become infected. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, applied with an intensity insufficient to cause the epidemic to die out, reduce the attack rate to 50% or less, and the epidemic is longer with a lower peak. If NPIs are lifted early, the epidemic may rebound, resulting in high percentages (more than 70%) of the population affected. If NPIs are applied with intensity high enough to cause the epidemic to die out, the attack rate can be reduced to between 1% and 25% of the population.
Conclusion: Applying NPIs with intensity high enough to cause the epidemic to die out would seem to be the preferred choice. Lifting disruptive NPIs such as shut-downs must be accompanied by enhancements to other NPIs to prevent new introductions and to identify and control any new transmission chains.},

Through a scoping review, we aimed to discern current mathematical models investigating ZIKV dynamics, focusing on its interplay with other pathogens, and to identify underlying assumptions and deficiencies supporting attention, particularly regarding the epidemiological attributes characterizing Zika outbreaks. Following the PRISMA-Sc guidelines, a systematic search across PubMed, Web of Science, and MathSciNet provided 137 pertinent studies from an initial pool of 2446 papers, showing a diversity of modelling approaches, predominantly centered on vector-host compartmental models, with a notable concentration on the epidemiological landscapes of Colombia and Brazil during the 2015–2016 Zika epidemic. While modelling studies have been important in explaining Zika transmission dynamics and their intersections with diseases such as Dengue, Chikungunya, and COVID-19 so far, future Zika models should prioritize robust data integration and rigorous validation against diverse datasets to improve the accuracy and reliability of epidemic prediction. In addition, models could benefit from adaptable frameworks incorporating human behavior, environmental factors, and stochastic parameters, with an emphasis on open-access tools to foster transparency and research collaboration.},

The model considers the sexual transmission dynamics of both viruses and vector-host interactions. We begin by exploring the qualitative behaviour of each model separately. We then analyze the dynamics of the co-infection model using the thresholds and results defined separately for each model. The model also considers the impact of intervention strategies, such as personal protection, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and sexual protection (condom use). Using available and assumed parameter values for Colombia and Brazil, the model is calibrated to investigate the long-term co-infection dynamics, the influence of specific parameters, and the potential effect of implementing these intervention strategies on co-infection spread. The study’s results revealed that the duration of Zika infection is a critical factor influencing the burden of co-infection cases. Additionally, bed nets and use of condoms are essential for disease control, while ART is less emphasized due to the cost-effectiveness of condom use.},

We have also included a few references to published reporting recommendations by these analytical groups. Knowledge translation does not end with a policy decision.

Under realistic biological conditions of assembly and disassembly, it is shown that such a delay is harmless and does not destabilize the organization of intermediate filaments in networks.

The general model is subsequently specialised to two-patch models, with two different scenarios regarding patch population size. Qualitative analyses show that the basic reproduction number acts as a sharp threshold between disease persistence and extinction. The concept of uniform weak persistence is used to prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium and disease uniform strong persistence under a certain condition.

 abstract = {Most mass gathering events have been suspended due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, with vaccination rollout, whether and how to organize some of these mass gathering events arises as part of the pandemic recovery discussions, and this calls for decision support tools. Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, was substantively scaled down in 2020 and it is still unclear if it will take place in 2021 and sub-sequent years. Considering the disease trends and vaccination conditions in the pilgrims' country of origin, and the operational and logistical aspects of implementing public health measures, Hajj reopening conditions could be very complex. Simulating disease transmission dynamics during the Hajj season under differ-ent conditions can provide some insights for better decision-making. Since most disease risk assessment models require data on the number and nature of possible close contacts between individuals, we seek to use integrated agent-based modeling and discrete events simulation techniques to capture risky contacts among the pilgrims in one of the Hajj major sites, namely Masjid-Al-Haram. In particular, we assessed different scenarios concerning the total number of pilgrims and enforced physical distancing measures. Our simulation results show that a plethora of risky contacts may occur during the rituals. Also, as the total number of pilgrims increases at each site, the number of risky contacts increases, and physical distancing measures may be challenging to maintain beyond a certain number of pilgrims in the site.},

We build a Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic- Infectious (prodromal phase)- Infectious (with symptoms) -Recovered (SEAIR) model with a household structure to investigate the potential of a safe reopening of a border, which can control disease spread but also allow for economic growth. We focus on the Ontario-USA border, considering an opening date of September 21, 2020. In addition to the instantaneous reproduction number, we also define a novel risk indicator by calculating daily new infections' percentile to inform risk levels promptly. Under ideal conditions, assuming extremely efficient border testing and strict traveler adherence to quarantine policy, the Ontario-USA can be reopened for a maximum daily number of 500 travelers entering Canada. A number exceeding 500 will stem an uncontrollable spread of the virus. Additionally, the current quarantine policy may not be sufficient under specific scenarios; hence testing measures at the border must be extremely efficient. Reopening of the Ontario-USA must consider the potential for disease spread (which can overburden healthcare resources) and economic growth. If a reopening plan is implemented, the local government must limit the number of daily entrances to 500 and enforce a mandatory quarantine, which may need to be stricter than current policy practice.},

 abstract = {Background: Globally, nonpharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19, including stay-at-home policies, limitations on gatherings and closure of public spaces, are being lifted. We explored the effect of lifting a stay-at-home policy on virus resurgence under different conditions.

Methods: Using confirmed case data from Toronto, Canada, between Feb. 24 and June 24, 2020, we ran a compartmental model with household structure to simulate the impact of the stay-at-home policy considering different levels of compliance. We estimated threshold values for the maximum number of contacts, probability of transmission and testing rates required for the safe reopening of the community.

Results: After the implementation of the stay-at-home policy, the contact rate outside the household fell by 39% (from 11.58 daily contacts to 7.11). The effective reproductive number decreased from 3.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.02-4.14) on Mar. 12 to 0.84 (95% CI 0.79-0.89) on May 6. Strong adherence to stay-at-home policies appeared to prevent SARS-CoV-2 resurgence, but extending the duration of stay-at-home policies beyond 2 months had little added effect on cumulative cases (25 958 for 65 days of a stay-at-home policy and 23 461 for 95 days, by July 2, 2020) and deaths (1404 for 65 days and 1353 for 95 days). To avoid a resurgence, the average number of contacts per person per day should be kept below 9, with strict nonpharmaceutical interventions in place.

Interpretation: Our study demonstrates that the stay-at-home policy implemented in Toronto in March 2020 had a substantial impact on mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In the context of the early pandemic, before the emergence of variants of concern, reopening schools and workplaces was possible only with other nonpharmaceutical interventions in place.},

 abstract = {Background: The monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic countries in recent months has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). It is thought that festivals, parties, and other gatherings may have contributed to the outbreak.

Methods: We considered a hypothetical metropolitan city and modeled the transmission of the monkeypox virus in humans in a high-risk group (HRG) and a low-risk group (LRG) using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and incorporated gathering events. Model simulations assessed how the vaccination strategies combined with other public health measures can contribute to mitigating or halting outbreaks from mass gathering events.

Results: The risk of a monkeypox outbreak was high when mass gathering events occurred in the absence of public health control measures. However, the outbreaks were controlled by isolating cases and vaccinating their close contacts. Furthermore, contact tracing, vaccinating, and isolating close contacts, if they can be implemented, were more effective for the containment of monkeypox transmission during summer gatherings than a broad vaccination campaign among HRG, when accounting for the low vaccination coverage in the overall population, and the time needed for the development of the immune responses. Reducing the number of attendees and effective contacts during the gathering could also prevent a burgeoning outbreak, as could restricting attendance through vaccination requirements.

Conclusion: Monkeypox outbreaks following mass gatherings can be made less likely with some restrictions on either the number and density of attendees in the gathering or vaccination requirements. The ring vaccination strategy inoculating close contacts of confirmed cases may not be enough to prevent potential outbreaks; however, mass gatherings can be rendered less risky if that strategy is combined with public health measures, including identifying and isolating cases and contact tracing. Compliance with the community and promotion of awareness are also indispensable to containing the outbreak.},

The animal reservoir is the key element in the modeling of zoonotic disease. Using a One Health approach, we model the spread of the MPX virus in humans considering potential animal hosts such as rodents (e.g., rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, etc.) and emphasize their role and transmission of the virus in a high-risk group, including gay and bisexual men-who-have-sex-with-men (gbMSM). From model and sensitivity analysis, we identify key public health factors and present scenarios under different transmission assumptions. We find that the MPX virus may spill over from gbMSM high-risk groups to broader populations if the efficiency of transmission increases in the higher-risk group. However, the risk of outbreak can be greatly reduced if at least 65% of symptomatic cases can be isolated and their contacts traced and quarantined. In addition, infections in an animal reservoir will exacerbate MPX transmission risk in the human population. Regions or communities with a higher proportion of gbMSM individuals need greater public health attention. Tracing and quarantine (or “effective quarantine” by postexposure vaccination) of contacts with MPX cases in high-risk groups would have a significant effect on controlling the spreading. Also, monitoring for animal infections would be prudent.},
